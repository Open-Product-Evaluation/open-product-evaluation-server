# Open Product Evaluation Server Admin Interface

Open Product Evaluation Server is a service which provides an API to evaluate different products e.g. apps or websites.
The difference to other survey apps is the focus on fast and easy reviews of your products which results in different types of questions like google forms or other survey apps usually provide.
